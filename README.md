# ProDr2 Clinic Management Systems | Database Systems
[Sep 2024 - Nov 2024]

## Brief Description
An enhanced version of the Clinic Management System redesigned to migrate from MariaDB to MongoDB, improving flexibility and scalability in managing patient records, appointments, and medication inventory.

## Contributions
Troubleshot and fixed compatibility issues in my original features (Medication List, Search, Quantity Management, Add/Delete Medications) that broke during the database transition from MariaDB to MongoDB.

Implemented an improved search feature by adding a dropdown filter for quicker and more precise medication queries.

Ensured smooth integration between the Flask backend and MongoDB, maintaining data consistency and user experience post-migration.

## Lessons Learnt
Gained hands-on experience in migrating relational DB designs to NoSQL (MongoDB), adapting schemas and queries for document-based storage.

Improved skills in debugging and troubleshooting cross-database compatibility issues.

Learned to design more user-friendly query interfaces (e.g., dropdown search) to enhance usability.

Understood trade-offs between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases in terms of scalability, flexibility, and query design.
